              It was Jeanine's 5th grade California History class that got her hooked on
              innovative brand strategies. Her constant curiosity of how a
              150-year-old denim brand aged so gracefully and continuously caught
              the attention of generations around the world sparked her nonstop
              quest in testing brand and marketing tactics.

              Dennis became interested in web deveopment when he learned that it was
              possible to record music in his bedroom. Once he got comfortable
              with using a DAW, the necessary skills to troubleshooting and
              starting a website were a necessity. He then became interested in the
              possibilities that web development held for him not only as a
              musician, but as a career.
